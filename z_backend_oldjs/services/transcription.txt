 Hi Nikunj! Hi! Since we are so close to launching our podcast, we have a few questions for you. Go for it! If you have to describe postcards in one line to the viewers, what would you say? I think postcards for me is a beautiful community for everyone who is interested in people, policy and politics. Interesting! What's the most unexpected thing that you have learnt while preparing for this podcast? That's a tough one. of fun I think one is my own breath of ignorance about everything that is happening in the world not just policy and I think the second thing would just be how much conversations can really help you evolve as a person as well I think postcards started just as a podcast and now the idea has evolved so much more into becoming a space for communities becoming a space for just learning and co-creating together. Do you have any message for the audience? 100% I think we are launching very very soon we have a wonderful line of conversations for you. Anish is going to talk about queerness and the identity in the modern times. Sanchita is going to talk about women in informal economy and another dear friend of mine for example Lucila is going to talk about climate and there are so many more conversations ahead of us so do join us the first episode with anish drops on the 11th on youtube spotify and other major platforms so yeah do uh follow us and see you soon thank you
